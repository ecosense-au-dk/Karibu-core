/** 
 * This package defines roles and implementations for the 
 * core abstraction of the Karibu producers of data. 
 *  
 * The main abstractions are the ClientRequestHandler with 
 * the central 'send(data)' method; the Serializer interface 
 * that the user of Karibu must implement to support 
 * the client request handler's serialization of data, and 
 * the ChannelConnector which binds the request handler 
 * to the actual inter process communication medium. 
 *  
 * The rabbitmq package contains an implementation of 
 * the ChannelConnector for RabbitMQ.
