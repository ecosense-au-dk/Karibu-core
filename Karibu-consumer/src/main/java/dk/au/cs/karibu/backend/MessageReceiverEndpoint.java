/** This is a Message Endpoint (Hohpe and Woolf, 2003) on the 
 * message receiver side; also called MessageReceiver in the 
 * JMS terminology. It is the top level abstraction in the
 * backtier Karibu framework and must be configured with
 * proper delegates to server the roles of message polling
 * and message processing. As it is highly configurable
 * the complexity of setting it up is also high. 
 * Therefore:
 * 
 * DO NOT INSTANTIATE IT DIRECTLY. INSTEAD USE THE BUILDER IN
 * MessageRecieverEndpointFactory.
 *  
 * It implements runnable and is required to run as a thread. 
 * Once started, the receiver endpoint will continously 
 * poll for messages using a PollingConsumer instance 
 * (Polling Consumer pattern, Hohpe and Woolf, 2003) 
 * that you provide. For every message received, 
 * it will be forwarded to the ServerRequestHandler 
 * instance that you provide for final processing.
 *  
 * If a connection failure occurs to the polling consumer
 * (in production, this is the RabbitMQ), the endpoint
 * will make an exponential backoff delay and then
 * retry the connection. The default initial wait time
 * is 500ms (increasing to 1000,2000,4000, etc.) up
 * until 10 reconnects have failed. You can specify
 * other "base delay" settings.
 * 
 * If ServerRequestHandler processing fails (in
 * production, this is typically MongoDB primary
 * failing and thus waiting for the replica set
 * to elect a new primary), then the message
 * pulled from the polling consumer is NOT
 * acknowledged (thus MQ will keep it in the queue), and
 * further processing is paused for a default
 * value of 30 seconds, after which the
 * normal operation is continued.
 *  
 * The process can be terminated by invoking 
 * 'stopReceiving', but as it is a polling consumer 
 * the receive loop will only terminate once the 
 * next message has been received.
