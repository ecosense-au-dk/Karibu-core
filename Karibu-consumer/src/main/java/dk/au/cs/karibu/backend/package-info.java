/** The Karibu backend core framework roles.
 * 
 * Karibu is a message oriented framework for collecting sensor data
 * and storing them in a backend storage. It provides A) a simple
 * (Java) client side API and default implementations for sending data
 * B) a backend API and default implementations based upon RabbitMQ
 * and MongoDB C) a running backend for the EcoSense project.
 * 
 * The backtier requires a running RabbitMQ server(s), one or
 * several Karibu daemons (this and other packages) and a
 * MongoDB instance (or a replica set).
 * 
 * The StandardDaemon (standard package) is the Java application
 * to run the daemon. It is configured with a MessageReceiverEndpoint
 * instance which in turn is configured through the builder in
 * MesageReceiverEndpointFactory. In module karibu-backend-production 
 * you can find the Ecosense production system configuration for
 * the standard daemon.
 *  
 * Emphasis has been put on staged testing approach: you can develop client 
 * side applications using light-weight (single-VM in-memory) implementations 
 * of all abstractions for speedy development and later gradually migrate 
 * to a local distributed setup (own rabbitmq and mongodb installations)  
 * and finally to our full EcoSense backtier system. 
 * 
 * Interfaces in this package define the core roles.
 * 
 * You will find bindings to RabbitMQ and MongoDB in the respective
 * sub packages.
 * 
 * The naming convention is that classes prefixed with 'StandardX'
 * are the framework implementation of the interfaces named 'X'
 * and it is located in the 'standard' sub package.
